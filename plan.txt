Game plan:



-- Extend onto proj-cc scraper
make a scraper to get all the data from rate my professor using python
multi thread parser


-- Create a text file, load to node js

-- Have node js load it in to memory for rating + professor

-- Extension will scrape all names put into json , make a ajax request to my server

-- Server returns a JSON where manipulate the data from there
